# DesignPatternsInPhp

There are lot of excellent resources out there explaining Design Patterns, that is why the goal of this repository is not to listing and explaining them all once again.

Here I want to share different scenarios that helped to understand and apply different design patterns to solve specific problems. So you are going to find:

- Examples I find in either books or articles that let me understand how to apply a certain pattern. I will refer to the book/article and summarize the problem to solve before going into the pattern design and implementation.
- [Some of my answers](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6053621/mgonzalezbaile) in Stackoverflow trying to help others.
- Real case problems I solved at some point. I am a [Domain Driven Design](https://www.google.es/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiO1s7Cp9XPAhUJXBQKHffUDhEQFggnMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDomain-driven_design&usg=AFQjCNFn_sjWNLTztiaphY3U7CATDr1nOg&bvm=bv.135475266,d.d24) practitioner so many of the Design Patterns listed here come from DDD or helped me to implement this approach.
