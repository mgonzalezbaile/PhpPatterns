### Weather Station
The first example, which shows how to use this pattern, is took from the book [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do). In the example there is a company asking us to build a set of displays that are able to show different weather measurements (humidity, pressure, temperature, ...). Those displays take the weather info from a [Weather Station](https://github.com/mgonzalezbaile/PhpPatterns/tree/master/src/PhpPatterns/Observer/WeatherStation) which consists of many [sensors](https://github.com/mgonzalezbaile/PhpPatterns/blob/master/tests/PhpPatterns/Observer/WeatherStation/WeatherSensorsTest.php) that are in charge of measuring and then calling the method `changeWeatherData` of the weather Station with the updated info. When that method is called the different displays ([CurrentWeatherConditionsDisplay](https://github.com/mgonzalezbaile/PhpPatterns/blob/master/src/PhpPatterns/Observer/WeatherStation/CurrentWeatherConditionsDisplay.php) and [WeatherStatisticsDisplay](https://github.com/mgonzalezbaile/PhpPatterns/blob/master/src/PhpPatterns/Observer/WeatherStation/WeatherStatisticsDisplay.php)) have to show the new incoming data.

As you can see here our Subject is the weather Station and its state (the weather info) can be changed by the sensors at any time. On the other side the displays are the Observers and they want to be notified every time the weather info is updated to show the new data.
